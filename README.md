# docker-gitea

This is a setup to run the Gitea git service as Docker containers.

## Configuration

Check the `docker-compose.override.yml` in the `samples` directory. Copy this file in the main directory, set the variables according to your local preferences and start up the docker-compose configuration using `docker-compose up -d`.
